AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive, accessible and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. This theme is designed and crafted based on [my personal blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog).

This theme follows best practices and provides accessibility out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by default. Moreover, additional color schemes can also be configured.

This theme is self-documented \_ which means articles/posts in this theme can also be considered as documentations. Read [the blog posts](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/) or check [the README Documentation Section](#-documentation) for more info.

_Note: I've tested screen-reader accessibility of AstroPaper using **VoiceOver** on Mac and **TalkBack** on Android. I couldn't test all other screen-readers out there. However, accessibility enhancements in AstroPaper should be working fine on others as well._

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of AstroPaper, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash
/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── logo.svg
│   │   └── logo.png
│   └── favicon.svg
│   └── astropaper-og.jpg
│   └── robots.txt
│   └── toggle-theme.js
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── socialIcons.ts
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   │   |  blog/
│   │   |    └── some-blog-posts.md
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
│   └── styles/
│   └── utils/
│   └── config.ts
│   └── types.ts
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Running Locally

You can start using this project locally by running the following command in your desired directory:

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create astro@latest --template satnaing/astro-paper

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create astro@latest -- --template satnaing/astro-paper

# yarn
yarn create astro --template satnaing/astro-paper

# pnpm
pnpm dlx create-astro --template satnaing/astro-paper
```

> **_Warning!_** If you're using `yarn 1`, you might need to [install `sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install) as a dependency.

Then start the project by running the following commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm run install

# start running the project
npm run dev
```

As an alternative approach, if you have Docker installed, you can use Docker to run this project locally. Here's how:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t astropaper .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 4321:80 astropaper
```

## Google Site Verification (optional)

You can easily add your [Google Site Verification HTML tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag) in AstroPaper using an environment variable. This step is optional. If you don't add the following environment variable, the google-site-verification tag won't appear in the HTML `<head>` section.

```bash
# in your environment variable file (.env)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-google-site-verification-value
```

> See [this discussion](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/discussions/334#discussioncomment-10139247) for adding AstroPaper to the Google Search Console.
