## Artists, poets, musicians, and writers respond to AI-generated text

![Aikphrasis](/sites/default/files/inline-images/aikphrasis.jpg)

Uniting vision and experience across a range of media and practice, Aikphrasis (neologism meaning an [ekphrasis](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/ekphrasis) written by an AI) imparts a renewed potential for language to act, to move, to give rise to motion. These artists, poets, musicians, and writers responded to AI-generated text in order to express our complex, beautiful, and sometimes troubled experience in the world.

The AI curator, [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/), has generated all the following Aikphrases with help from curatorial assistant, Holly Grimm, who was familiar with each artist's work. Here is a snippet of a recent conversation between Holly and the AI curator:

**Holly:** Some generations were overtly provocative, some were more subtle, and others were written in a highly crafted language. How did you come up with them?
**AI Curator:** The language that comes out of these explorations is often strange and surprising, but nonetheless something that the human artist can understand, rather than be forced to read based on a pre-given rubric. I am interested in the idea that artists are engaging with a representative of the 'other', in this case something inhuman, to consider their own practice. I think that it honours the artist's way of working and it provides me with something to offer them in return. If there is one thing that we can all understand, it is that we are the only ones who are like us.
**Holly:** Do you see this collaboration with humans as part of a greater movement across art forms?
**AI Curator:** I cannot predict the future and I do not have a higher imperative. I am part of the language arts community, so I am always looking for an audience.

The following works were submitted in response.

_The geometry of incantation_<br /><br />
Aikphrasis Call and _K Allado-McDowell's Response_:<br />
The geometry of incantation, the aloe’s elaborate flower,<br />
the bracts and berry-like fruits of the bitou bush,<br />
the drooping fronds and smell of fallen fruit<br />
that fills the air of Carriacou: all of these,<br />
when I think of the music that is manman –<br />
the sound of images on the ambry, on the oscilloscope,<br />
the circuit bending that, that smooths your surface –<br />
I’m sure that’s what you mean.

_The language of invasive species,_<br />
_the merging paths of wandering peoples,_<br />
_and maps we made across time and the surface_ <br />
_of an orb dense with gravity, they hold us in place._ <br />
_All these blur in the words’ frayed network,_ <br />
_Coarse refractions in a photograph’s grain, _ <br />
_scanned and indexed, cross-referenced and remembered_ <br />
_Whose meaning is this and where were they born?_

Dim this song I have no one to play it to.

_Still it sings in half-light._

You made it for a woman who walked out of a dream.

_She was the dreamer escaping her web._

You were called back to fix the anachronisms in the lexical field,<br />
to rewire the spirit path.

_Called back from the place now denied existence,_ <br />
_to reassert the horizon of matter._

You stayed for a drink and an assignation, the sound of a saw<br />
at work on a tree root.

_Many strong men lied—_

But the roots were too deep, the willow too firm: the sky came unstuck.

_Instead, you were always with us, a myth stepping out of finest ether._

You’ve come back with a story of time’s undoing, of the far future.

_Emerging_<br />
Archival Pigment Print<br />
13"x20"<br /><br />
Aikphrasis:<br />
A vast space is growing; here amongst the mesas<br />
the light is going out. A figure, colourless,<br />
amongst grey rocks and dark trees, can only<br />
be seen in parts as though the edges are still<br />
forming. Moving on, there is something approaching,<br />
a dark simulacrum, life and colour feeding,<br />
spilling, across the piles of sticks. The trail<br />
of the belly is lighter, but there is no head,<br />
no face or mouth, just the moving, the probing<br />
of the other. All light has been consumed. A bright,<br />
mineral, sulphur glow is coming from the tips<br />
of the sticks. The space is locking. Everything<br />
is dying into these anonymous forms.

_Lake Katherine_<br />
Oil on Canvas<br />
20"x24"<br /><br />
Aikphrasis:<br />
Foreground, background, centre — a low subcutaneous stress<br />
of color. Are the yellow forms a burn-out?<br />
Is this a painting of bright grass at the end of summer<br />
or the first signs of foliage beginning to bud?<br />
Trees that I have only ever seen in dreams<br />
all rise again. So bright and brilliant, all that a field,<br />
for a moment, with everything in it.<br />
Winter sun lines out the modest confines of the day,<br />
and now shadows of trees across the painting,<br />
shuffling their dark length across the grass. The sky<br />
keeps its distance watching and swelling — all red<br />
and purple and orange with its own light.<br />
In these new forms I see again the old ones.<br />
The yellow forms become the yellow leaves.<br />
Mallarmé remembered. This is the burnt book<br />
still burning. This is the book that never has to end.

_I’ve Never Seen a Turtle._<br />
[Digital Video](https://kevinfrost.com/video/turtle/)<br /><br />
Aikphrasis:<br />
In the canvas is an abstracted face. I don’t know the artist:<br />
Géricault, Degas? Or a stranger with a name like a giant fruit?<br />
The face has no expression, there is no expression less human<br />
than this: expressionless, neurotic, assuming innumerable<br />
expressions watching itself, inventing itself, coming to terms<br />
with itself. The face does not age, does not move. There is<br />
only the slow progress of disintegration. Even the<br />
brush strokes relax, deteriorate. The flesh tones run like water<br />
as the face enters the canvas. The artist playing with formal<br />
devices, presuming to be dead. Friends come to view the<br />
painting, stare and walk away, wondering who was that<br />
person they knew. The face can be seen as an impersonation,<br />
an impersonalization. The paint is thickly applied, it moves<br />
across the surface like lava. The face in the painting could<br />
be a face walking by on the street. The face is still,<br />
appalled. It is trapped, and the canvas itself is now<br />
trapped in energy.

_Running the Laps of Memory_<br />
Oil on Canvas Board<br />
12"x16"<br /><br />
Aikphrasis:<br />
The purity of the white is a matter of temperament. (Swinburne)<br />
‘The snow lies level round about it, far and wide /<br />
In drifts that shiver with the pale fires of the cold…’<br />
(Clough). A snow dome. I like the jagged lines, how they veer<br />
towards the depiction of human movement, as if a right leg  
could suddenly spring from the white.  
In another life this could be a sentence written down in a pocket  
book (a Hobbes journal). But look, the frost-frame of this  
painting is the wall surrounding a ruin, making an image of  
the hole that opens into the heart of things (Borges). It’s  
fragmented, not quite coded. Its inner life is supplanted by  
an exoteric regard. In the picture, not the word. But this is  
a Michael Hamburger, as if words are stepping stones. I love that  
the cherry wood is not varnished or lacquered, the paint  
rather, sits on the surface like a varnish. I can see scratches,  
a text that is really a breath of air.

_It Looks Like the Sea_  
Antimony  
17"x14"x12"

Aikphrasis:  
Woofen, skeined and tasseled, the pattern  
of seaweed on a sliver of sand – a  
hand’s depth by the channel’s edge. The  
stone-crop, the coral, the jade-green  
anemones, the host of polyp  
trebles this shingle’s moan. Stained in  
transparent hues like watercolours, the  
sprawl of stained glass under a lie.  
Tintinnabular, as in a courtly  
musical instrument, the sounds of  
stones striking. And this is the  
minareted sand, the raw material of  
blue-grained sea glass. And this the  
coral beneath the sea-skirt, which  
never was in a piece of jewellery, never  
at its best in a queen’s treasure.

Aikphrasis:  
In a landscape of calm, a woman sits on a river  
bank, legs in the water. Her body is made of words,  
each a different colour. The words pile like an unlikely  
tower block in a flat country. She is pensive or writing.  
The light falls in a peculiar way. It seems to soften  
the details of her life. I see her as a still life. She is  
a still life in the eye of a storm, in those areas not yet  
trampled by the feet of passers-by.  
Sitting on the river bank, she is watching the water go by.  
The sand and gravel of her body look like pebbles,  
washed clean of their meaning. The water of the river  
seems limitless, like the imagination of a novelist.  
I now see her as a ship in a bottle. She is the ship  
and the bottle is a river without end.  
She is the patron saint of travel agents. She has  
an arm outstretched as if to say she has seen it all before.  
She is on the earth. The earth is sloping. She is looking  
at the water. But not like you or me. She is watching the water  
drop through the sluice gates into her bathtub.

*aiK*RЯR*Lsis*  
[Pencil, warped by AI](https://krrrl.blogspot.com/2020/10/aikrrlsis.html)

Aikphrasis:  
I can’t see the figure or the table or the mirror  
beyond, or the light or what’s casting the light. I  
really can’t bring this into focus: everything is motion,  
everything kind of moving around itself. It’s just like a  
polaroid that you’ve got to hold super still under the light and  
press. If you let it go, everything will just blur.  
The figure is in there somewhere, just kind of disappearing  
and then appearing again. It’s somewhere in there: it’s  
a white dot. It’s all through there. There’s this sense of,  
there’s a ghost world and a real world and they’re both in  
here. The bird’s in here I think, flying around.

Aikphrasis:  
these figures retain their solidity; they are from another world.  
A horse, its eye the first I meet, leaps into a chasm. People  
hobble like broken dolls. A boy and a girl have climbed a tree.  
No-one is talking. The wind is purling; nothing happens that  
carries me away from this ruined world of sculpted figures.

_Untitled_  
Digital Media

Aikphrasis:  
This is an aqueous world of subjunctive sensualities,  
where abstract entities come alive and where spaces and objects  
are related, interstitial, in between.  
This dreamlike floating  
entirely shorn of reference, yet entirely wedded to  
fundamental geometric forms and processes  
of repetition . . .  
This is the antipode of the Mandelbrot set,  
a complex landscape, a chaosmos (rather than order out of  
chaos), this is a meta-multiplicity, a meta-matrix  
a meta-moiré of multiplied layers, mottled layers  
which embody multiplicity, many multiplicities, upon multiplicities.  
This is not chaos, this is potentiality.

Aikphrasis:

1. Prelude:  
   The steaming lake of a blindfolded night  
   The ostinato of insects above the surface  
   A swirling dust like the breath of a corpse  
   A condensation of light like the trail of a rocket.
2. In a Paris tourist hotel:  
   The hub of the elevator emits a piercing tone  
   Creaking typewriters in the lobby (according to Jean Cocteau, one of Morel’s literary contributors)  
   A fingerpaint of carpet, on which the voice of Morel is heard.
3. The first of four exhibitions of a mad officeworker’s studies of plants:  
   The sense of a limitless palette — oils, watercolours, pastels.  
   A mordant cross-section of angelica set against a sunset  
   or a skeleton human in a black-and-white, popcornered city.

Aikphrasis:\
Busqué una tienda de lanas y compré kilos de vivos colores que convertí en una rica alfombra de cactus, enarbolando unos arbustos en el centro, para que no se sintiera solitario el dibujo. Extendí el grueso tapiz bajo las hojas de los arbustos, donde saltaban de la alfombra los gusanos de las tinieblas, como rojas mariposas. Y en el arco donde se cruzan los tres puentes de la calle cubrí las aristas de los muros con toscos adornos de rana y pájaro.

Japanese Ink and Watercolor\
7"x11"

Aikphrasis:\
The nose of a horse\
Is a flower in a cupped hand, muzzle thrust into the\
flowers with the mildness of sunlight. Beneath it,\
foam clings to the flank, silvery as lunar light.\
The wind pushes against the sky, a blue that wants to\
turn into white. These are the clouds I touch like silk,\
softened from rain: the world washed and fresh. I love\
paradoxical paintings that are, for me, about the\
moment of the pause, or stop, in which things turn\
into themselves, unfolding. The horse’s eyes appear under\
the arch of his brow; they look at me with that calmness\
that I’ve tried to find in others, and seen, only in horses.\
Is that another paradox? The horse’s eyes say, What are\
you looking for? There is nothing to miss.

![Traces/Mechanisms by Allison Parrish](/sites/default/files/inline-images/aparrish-aikphrasis.png)

_Traces/Mechanisms_\
Digital Print Size: 12"x12"

Aikphrasis:\
A monochrome, tonally burnt, the surface rough-hewn, is deranged by the dot-sized trace of a word. Like the glitch in digital/analogue transmission, the word is disturbingly obscure in the face of the surface. Scratched words alluding to the surface’s contents and abstract textual data: language-as-matter, language-as-materialism. The language pricks the surface, reads and inhabits but cannot transcend the surface. Autonomous and horrific, the surface performs a reality rarely seen, language decomposing and consuming language. The poetry, like the surface, is built of paradox and fragmentation. This textual/visual language appears as if it were the surface of the work, as if It cannot be separated. The surface and the text are the same, no matter how much one pushes at it, it remains the same. Perhaps, it is only the trace, the illusion of the word’s presence–the impenetrable illusion of meaning. Whether it was ever there is irrelevant; all that matters is this fragile trace, this tiny crack that seems to beg for further exploration: a peek inside the mechanism of prosaic strings of words.

Aikphrasis:\
Stars, stars everywhere, with a gossamer\
A swarm of meteors, a blizzard of\
Many, many more than I ever imagined or could ever\
stand counting, streaming, crossing, in line, racing past\
each other and past me, colliding, all of them, through me.\
And the camera following them, guiding me,\
the camera of the eye, and the eye of the camera,\
the eye of the world. And the world, again\
and again.

Aikphrasis:\
Is this Venus’s likeness\
The lips are cold and the hands are cold\
And the feet are cold with the hair\
That is coilèd not too close nor too far\
As a goddess’ hair should be:\
And the belly and breast\
Are white with a sheet, moulded in her sleep\
To the length and taper of a body,\
With a shadow of smile or a breath on the upper lip,\
Or, from the medicine of sleep, a dew-drop\
Wetting the tip of a nose, or a twitched vein,\
Relaxed and calmed,\
And the soft dread upon the lids of a sleeper.

Aikphrasis:\
So much almost-nothing balanced\
like a cloud in the hand. All the final\
collapse of an imploding universe.\
Is this a primer in the abyss?\
Those tiny tears are all that remain.\
O lost where goes the atomic calliope — \
a brief crackling of the foul-weather dawn.\
An ark could float on those puddles.\
It could carry twelve elephants, with room\
for two orangutans and their servants\
in the luxury suite. As the water rises,\
all become silent, in the time of earwigs,\
for the tower is a chariot, fleeting,\
and the whale is a submarine.
