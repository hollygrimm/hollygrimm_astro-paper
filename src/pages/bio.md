**Holly Grimm**

I am Diné (Navajo). I am of the Bit'ahnii (Within His Cover) people and born for Bilagáana (Anglo). My maternal grandfather’s clan is Tachii'nii (Red Running Into the Water), and my paternal grandfather’s clan is Bilagáana (Anglo).

Born in Denver, Colorado; schooled at Stanford University; based in New Mexico.

My work begins with creating sketches "en plein air" or "on location" of New Mexico landscapes. By creating a direct impression of a scene, I become a medium for the vital energy of the landscape (nilch’i or qi). The resulting studio paintings provide the viewer with an opportunity for dynamic contemplation and meditation.

The colors in my paintings mimic the natural dyes of Navajo rugs. I use modern organic pigments to mix transparent browns and ochres. When these colors are mixed with acrylic mediums and applied with varying thicknesses, they create encaustic-like depth and luminosity.

I'm influenced by the form and philosophy of Chinese landscape paintings, particularly the relationship between negative space and taoist concept of Wu Wei.

Additionally I'm interested in using Machine Learning to create works of art. I've written a neural net, [ACAN](/acan_final), to augment AI-generated art with values of art composition such as texture, contrast, and color.
